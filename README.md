# attiny85_and_encoder_EC11
A simple example of attiny85 and encoder operation using an interrupt. Using a couple of 100nf capacitors and program algorithm to arrest the switch bounce noise. The ability to connect external devices via TWI has been saved. The code is written in AtmelStudio.

Changed the algorithm for encorer with half-step.
